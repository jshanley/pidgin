# Stream and Artifacts

source: conversations/artifacts-and-the-stream.md

**Conversations** — the stream, unbounded, temporal

**Artifacts** — self-contained, bounded

An artifact is anything that stands alone. The system doesn't need to know what kind — only that it's:
- Complete in itself
- Small enough to hold (working memory / context window)
- Linked to its source when relevant

The stream contains artifacts. They precipitate inline, then get pointed at. Creating the artifact file is the act of pointing — saying "this is a thing."

Duplication isn't the cost. It's the evidence that something condensed.
