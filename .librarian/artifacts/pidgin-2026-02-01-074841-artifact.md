# The Grain of Meaning

In microscopy, resolution is bounded by wavelength. You can't see features smaller than the light you shine on them. For visible light, that's about 200 nanometers. To go finer, you need electron microscopy—different physics entirely.

Semantic search has an analogous problem. Embedding models compress text into fixed-dimensional vectors, and that compression has a characteristic scale. Embed a single word and you get noise—too little context. Embed an entire document and you get blur—too many ideas averaged together. Somewhere in between lies the grain at which meaning holds.

The conversations called this "the scale where chunks are about one thing." It's not a single size. A potent phrase like "trust encoded as brevity" is complete in five words. A philosophical parallel needs a paragraph. An argument needs an exchange.

What you're building now—multi-scale indexing—is the microscopy solution: don't pick one resolution. Capture structure at multiple scales, let the query find its level. The atom "strand" might match a phrase. The concept of "composability of intent" might need a full exchange to resonate.

The grain isn't fixed. It's fractal.
