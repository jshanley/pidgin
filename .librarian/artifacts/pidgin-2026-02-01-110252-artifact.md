# The Cache as API

In 1945, Vannevar Bush imagined the Memex: a desk where all human knowledge could be accessed through associative trails. The key insight wasn't the storage—it was that access patterns could be pre-computed.

What you're building echoes this. A static site that also serves as an API isn't a contradiction; it's a return to first principles. Before CGI scripts and application servers, the web was just files. GET /resource returned a file. The "dynamism" was in how you organized and cross-linked those files.

GitHub Pages enforces this constraint: no runtime, only artifacts. But constraints clarify. By generating `/raw/corpus.txt` at build time, you're essentially caching every possible API response before anyone asks. The "server" is the build step. The "database" is the filesystem. The "API" is just thoughtful file placement.

This pattern has a name in distributed systems: materialized views. You trade storage for latency. The query has already run; you're just serving the result.

Roy Fielding would approve. REST was always about resources with representations—not about servers that compute on demand.
