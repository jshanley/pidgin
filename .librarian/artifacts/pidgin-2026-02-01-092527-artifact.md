# The Observer's Paradox in System Boundaries

In 1927, Werner Heisenberg articulated something physicists had been circling: the act of measurement changes what you measure. The observer cannot be fully separated from the system.

Claude Code's `SessionEnd` hook faces a quieter version of this problem. When does a conversation end? The system must decide—but the decision itself shapes the boundary.

The hook fires on explicit signals: `/clear`, logout, terminal close. But what about the conversation that trails off? The user who walks away? The laptop lid that closes mid-thought? These aren't captured because they aren't *events*—they're absences.

This mirrors a deeper pattern in distributed systems: you cannot reliably detect the difference between "slow" and "dead." The Two Generals Problem proves you can never have perfect consensus about state transitions across an unreliable channel.

So the transcript saves what it can observe. The rest—the unfinished thought, the interrupted session—becomes dark matter in the conversation archive. Present by its absence.
