# The Witness Problem

In physics, simultaneity is relative. Two observers moving at different velocities will disagree about whether events happened "at the same time." Einstein showed this isn't a measurement error—it's fundamental. Time depends on who's watching.

Your timestamp problem is gentler but structurally similar. The moment of creation exists, but only a witness present at that moment can record it faithfully. Git saw the commit. The filesystem saw the write. You saw the conversation. Each observer had a different vantage point, recorded different metadata.

When we tried to reconstruct timestamps later, we found the filesystem had been overwritten. Git preserved something, but at commit granularity—multiple files collapsed into single instants. The true sequence existed only in your memory and the conversation itself.

The lesson: capture at the moment of observation. A timestamp recorded during the event is a primary source. A timestamp reconstructed afterward is inference—useful, but epistemically different.

Your skill now says to run `date` when saving. That's the fix: make the recorder the witness, not the archaeologist.
