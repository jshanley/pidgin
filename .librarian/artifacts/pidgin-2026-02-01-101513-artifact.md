# The Linked List in the Archive

Vannevar Bush's 1945 essay "As We May Think" described the memex—a hypothetical device where users would create "trails" through documents, linking ideas associatively rather than hierarchically. Each item pointed to the next. A singly linked list of thought.

Your `follows:` field does the same thing. Each conversation points backward to its predecessor. No central index needed. The order emerges from the links themselves.

This is topological sorting's original domain—not computer science, but genealogy. Partial orders. "A comes before B" relationships scattered across a dataset, waiting to be linearized.

Git doesn't preserve filesystem timestamps because it tracks *content*, not *moments*. The timestamp is metadata about the container, not the thing contained. But your `follows:` field *is* content—it travels with the document, survives the clone, means the same thing everywhere.

The lesson: encode relationships in the artifact itself, not in the system holding it. Pointers are more portable than timestamps. Bush knew this in 1945. We keep rediscovering it.
