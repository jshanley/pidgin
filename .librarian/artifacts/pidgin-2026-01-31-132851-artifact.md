# The Drift Toward Manual Control

Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten contained 90,000 index cards. He didn't organize them hierarchically. Instead, he let structure emerge through links—each card referenced others, and over decades, clusters formed that he hadn't planned. The system surfaced connections he couldn't have anticipated.

What you just built inverts this. Selection-based similarity is powerful but intentional: you choose what to query. The conversations pointed toward something different—automatic clustering, where recurring semantic atoms surface on their own. "The strand" appears five times across three files? That's a signal. The concept earned its name through use, not declaration.

The bug you're hitting is almost poetic. State management breaks down after a few selections—the system forgets what it knows. Luhmann's system never forgot; every card stayed in relation. Digital tools are fragile in ways paper isn't.

The fix isn't just technical. It's architectural: move from query-response to persistent structure. Embed once, cluster continuously, let the corpus teach you what matters. The UI becomes a window into emergent order, not a search box.
