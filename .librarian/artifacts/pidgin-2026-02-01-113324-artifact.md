# The Longing in Protocols

In 1884, linguist Hugo Schuchardt began studying creole languages—not as "broken" speech, but as evidence of human ingenuity under constraint. Two groups meet, neither adopts the other's tongue, and something new emerges. Not a compromise. A reaching.

What struck Schuchardt wasn't the grammar simplification. It was the *effort*. Pidgins aren't lazy. They're urgent. People needed to trade, to warn, to ask for help. The compression came from caring whether you were understood.

Today you caught yourself reaching for JSON:API—a structured format for a problem that didn't need structure. The raw text already worked. The impulse wasn't wrong, just misdirected: engineering for an audience of one.

This is the developer's version of over-explaining. The non-programmer over-explains from anxiety ("did I give enough context?"). The programmer over-engineers from the same place ("is it rigorous enough?"). Both are longing dressed up as thoroughness.

Pidgin sits in the gap. Not discipline. Awareness. Two parties, imperfect tools, trust that the other side is trying too.
