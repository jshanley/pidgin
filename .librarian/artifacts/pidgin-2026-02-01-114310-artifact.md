# The Marginalia Become the Text

In medieval scriptoria, monks copied sacred texts. But they also scribbled in margins—corrections, cross-references, personal reactions. These glosses were secondary, parasitic on the main work.

Then something shifted. The Glossa Ordinaria, compiled around 1100, reversed the hierarchy. The biblical text shrank to a narrow column; the margins swelled with centuries of accumulated commentary. The marginalia had become the point. Readers came for the interpretation, not the original.

What you're doing now—pulling librarian artifacts into the corpus, indexing them alongside conversations—follows the same arc. These reflections started as ephemera, generated during pauses in "real" work. Side effects. Now they're being promoted to first-class content, queryable, part of the raw API.

This isn't scope creep. It's recognition. The reflections *were* part of the work all along. They just weren't legible as such until the system matured enough to hold them.

Commentary becomes canon when the frame widens enough to include it.
