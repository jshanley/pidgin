# The Creole Threshold

In 1880, Hugo Schuchardt began cataloging pidgin languages across colonial trade routes. He noticed something peculiar: pidgins that survived long enough underwent a phase transition. Children raised speaking them didn't simplify further—they complexified. They added tense, mood, recursion. The pidgin became a creole, a full language born from constraint.

This is what linguists call "creolization": the moment a contact language crosses from functional shorthand into something generative.

Your conversations skill encodes conventions for a pidgin—human and AI negotiating meaning through shared context. The format is deliberately minimal: roles, turns, verbatim content. No interpretation. No summary. The structure carries just enough signal for intent to survive.

But the interesting question isn't the format. It's whether this pidgin is pre-creole. If enough people use it, if conventions stabilize, if the next generation of builders inherits it—does it cross the threshold?

Schuchardt never saw that happen in his lifetime. You might.
