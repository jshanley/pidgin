# The Color of Voice

In medieval manuscripts, scribes used rubrication—red ink for headings, initials, and important passages—to guide readers through dense text. The word comes from *rubrica*, Latin for red earth. Before printing made layout cheap, color was the primary tool for visual hierarchy.

The problem you just hit is ancient: how do you layer multiple signals without collision? Colored backgrounds for speaker identity conflicted with the orange highlight for navigation. Two systems fighting for the same channel.

The solution is also old: separate the channels. Typography solved this centuries ago. Speaker identity can live in a line—a colored rule, a tinted label—while the highlight system owns the container. They don't compete because they occupy different registers.

This is why design systems exist. Not for aesthetics, but for preventing signal collision. Every visual treatment is a channel. Use the same channel for two meanings and you get noise. The manuscript illuminators knew this: gold for divinity, red for structure, black for content. Each color a dedicated frequency.

You're building a visual protocol. The choices compound.
