I noticed they only integrate into claude code when I add them to my user-level ~/.claude folder. the ones I add in a specific project don't integrate into the claude session as slash commands\n\n## assistant\n\nThat's an interesting observation. Let me take a look at how your commands are structured in both locations to understand the difference.\n\nAfter investigating, I found a `skills` folder rather than `commands` at the user level. The skill format uses a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description`). The frontmatter is what registers it as an available slash command.\n\nThe key structure is:\n```\n~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md\n```\n\nFor project-level skills, it should work the same way at `.claude/skills/` in your project root. A few things to check:\n\n1. **Directory name**: Should be `.claude/skills/`, not `.claude/commands/`\n2. **File must be `SKILL.md`** (capitalized) with YAML frontmatter\n3. **Frontmatter format**:\n   ```yaml\n   ---\n   name: my-skill\n   description: What the skill does and when to invoke it.\n   ---\n   ```\n\n## user\n\nlet's setup a project-level skill about conversations. I'll need you to do a little research on how skills work in the latest claude docs. I want the skill to be minimal and just teach claude some conventions. read the existing conversations, particularly the first one about pidgin origins and the second one on structure.\n\n## assistant\n\nAfter researching the Claude Code docs and reading the conversations, I created `.claude/skills/conversations/SKILL.md`.\n\nKey points from my research on skills:\n\n1. **Project-level skills work the same as user-level** - path is `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`\n2. **The old `.claude/commands/` still works** but skills are the newer approach with more features\n3. **Discovery**: Claude Code scans both `~/.claude/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` at project root\n4. **Frontmatter matters**: `name` becomes the slash command (if user-invocable), `description` is what Claude uses to decide when to load it\n\nThe skill captures conventions:\n- Location: `conversations/`\n- Naming: topic-based, not numbered\n- Order: filesystem creation time or `follows:` field\n- Content: verbatim, no summary\n- Format: markdown with YAML frontmatter, `## user` / `## assistant` delimiters\n\n## user\n\noh, but what if the actions are implicit. if the user says \"save the conversation\" this skill should be invoked\n\n## assistant\n\nGood point. Updated it to be model-invocable so Claude loads it when you ask to save conversations. Removed `user-invocable: false` - now Claude will automatically load the skill when you say things like \"save this conversation\" or \"look at past conversations.\"\n\n## user\n\nwe should be able to also record part of a conversation and add more to it later. it should be append-only but possible. for example, I want to restart claude, but I don't want you to lose this conversation, so why don't you record this much and then we'll pick it back up on the other side\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":64,"oldLines":3,"newStart":64,"newLines":41,"lines":[" ## user"," "," we should be able to also record part of a conversation and add more to it later. it should be append-only but possible. for example, I want to restart claude, but I don't want you to lose this conversation, so why don't you record this much and then we'll pick it back up on the other side","+","+## assistant","+","+Recorded.
